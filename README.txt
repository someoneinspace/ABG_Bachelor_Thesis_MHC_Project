Pipeline was divided into three parts with their corrresponding folders: first part pipeline up until the plink, the second part pipeline up until creating the combined whole SNP data, the third part pipeline
which is actually not a pipeline but the scripts for each analysis. Detailed info was written in "README.txt" files in the folders, please start with reading them. Also, some other necessary files
that are not scripts were added for the convenience.
